Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a FSM detection circuit that detects a single bit input IN. When the number of 1s in the input is modulo 5, the result is 4, output MATCH is high, and MATCH is 0 in other cases.

Module name:  
    fsm               
Input ports：
    input CLK,
    input RST,
    input IN
Output ports：
    output reg MATCH

The module is a finite state machine with 5 states, the finite state machine is shown below:
states: s0, s1, s2, s3, s4
Outputs: s0: 0, s1: 0, s2: 0, s3: 0, s4: 1
Transitions:
  s0: 0 -> s0, 1 -> s1
  s1: 0 -> s1, 1 -> s2
  s2: 0 -> s2, 1 -> s3
  s3: 0 -> s3, 1 -> s4
  s4: 0 -> s4, 1 -> s0

Please generate the verilog code for the finite state machine.
